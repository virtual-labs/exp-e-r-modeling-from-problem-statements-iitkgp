### About the Experiment 
Developing databases is a very important task to develop a system. Before going to form exact database tables and establishing relationships between them, we conceptually or logically can model our database using ER diagrams.

In this experiment we will learn how to find the entities, its attributes and how the relationships between the entities can be established for a system.
